# EV-RNA
# Selective enrichment of plasma cell-free messenger RNA in cancer-associated extracellular vesicles

This is a repository for processing cell-free RNA-sequencing data that has been fractionated by size exclusion columns. 
* This is implemented in snakemake for all data processing.
* All downstream scripts for generating figures are located in the `code/` directory.
