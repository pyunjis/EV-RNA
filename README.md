# Selective enrichment of plasma cell-free messenger RNA in cancer-associated extracellular vesicles

This is a repository for processing cell-free RNA sequencing data from human plasma that has been fractionated by size exclusion columns. We sequenced total cell-free messenger RNA from 120 size-fractionated extracellular carriers (medium EVs, small EVs, non-EV particles, and soluble plasma protein fractions associated with early-, middle-, and late-eluting proteins) using lung cancer, liver cancer, multiple myeloma and healthy control sample set. Using Stranded SMART-Seq method along with the use of ERCC spike in controls for normalization, we observed specific enrichment patterns of cancer-associated cf-mRNA in EVs. 

* This is implemented in Snakemake for RNA sequencing data processing. 
* All downstream scripts for generating figures are located in the `code/` directory.
